# face-detection-annotation
This repo is all about face detection annotation.  Face Detection detects multiple faces within an image along with the associated key facial attributes such as emotional state or wearing headwear . Specific individual Facial Recognition is not supported. Note: The Vision API now supports offline asynchronous batch image annotation for all features.
